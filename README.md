### Well hello 👋



- 👩‍💻 I'm Julia
- 📍 I'm based in Amsterdam
- ❤️‍🔥 My passion is React (somehow, I just got stuck in the love for the framework + Native of course)
  - *Psssst!! Here's a [template for React Native that I just created](https://github.com/Tokels/react-native-template)*
  - *I used an agile workflow, [check out this Project Board to see how I structured the project](https://github.com/orgs/Tokels/projects/2/views/2")*
- 💡 I'm currently working on the second release of my react-native-template, implement setup for authentication
- 🏢 I'm currently a IT/Frontend Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abnamro.com/nl/home">ABN Amro</a>
- 🏛️ Fun fact: I was an architect prior to dev
- 🎤 I also do public speaking, like this speech at an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eZnXZx77Ac" target="_blank">Uber Engineering event</a>
